# ES-96-Engineering-Problem-Solving-and-Design
As part of the engineering curriculum, we worked with a client for a semester to solve a problem that we self defined within the preliminary part of the class using. Our client, Dana-Farber Cancer Instituteâ€™s Global Health Initiative, asked us to identify engineering solutions that could reduce the global unequal access to paediatric oncology care and associated disparities in outcomes, namely the huge gap in survival rates in more versus less economically developed countries.
Through a process of investigation and ideation, where our team spent six weeks collecting and synthesising both qualitative and quantitive data through in-person interviews and secondary research, we identified a problem we could tackle. We discovered a significant enough rate of sepsis development within paediatric cancer patients and determined that these could be mitigated significaly through the efficient and reliable communication, collection and interpretation of patient data. By narrowing down a large set of ideas through several criteria, we decided to develop a paediatric vital sign monitor.
